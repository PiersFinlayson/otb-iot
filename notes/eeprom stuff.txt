added headers for Raspberry Pi Hat hdr + atoms
increased serial number length in hw common (to allow UUID)
note uuids should be in lower case, but case insensitive input

should espi have uuid (as well as serial)?

for rpi hats (module) need this info:
  2       pid         product ID
  2       pver        product version
  1       vslen       vendor string length (bytes)
  1       pslen       product string length (bytes)
  X       vstr        ASCII vendor string e.g. "ACME Technology Company"
  Y       pstr        ASCII product string e.g. "Special Sensor Board"
Don't have any of this - feels like we should hat version (for otb-iot hats as well).  vendor string is necessary.  product string is useful.  pid could fit into existing module_type, but some values already taken.
Maybe add vendor string into internal structure, although tricky as no max length.
Then existing module type can be split between pid and pver.  TBC whether to include vendor string - but feels like useful.
